    <string name="text_additional_information">The first contact with a new customer is a perfect time to engage them even more by offering a gift or a special price. On the one hand, the customer will feel rewarded for their effort and build a more positive attitude towards you. On the other hand, an offer will urge them to start shopping or, at least, browsing immediately. And if the offer is time-limited, thatâ€™s an additional motivation to shop while the offer lasts.</string>
